Team bi0s hardware challenge 1.

## Description

This code is written to blink 8 led light one after the another using Arduino.

## Getting Started

### Equipment required

* Arduino uno R3.
* Breadboard small.
* 8 led lights.
* Wires.

### Installing

* Place the led lights in the Breadboard
* One end of led should be connected to output pin of arduino board.
* The other end of led should be connected to ground pin of arduino board.
* Simillary connect do all the 7 leds in the same way.
* Now write the code.
